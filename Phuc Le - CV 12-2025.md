Graduated with a PhD in Applied Physics, I am currently the Head of Research and Content at Concero, where I build blockchain interoperability solutions. I lead protocol research, technical writing, and go-to-market content for a cross-chain messaging protocol. I work across product, engineering, and leadership to turn technical tradeoffs into clear decisions, documentation, and partner-facing materials. I also support partnerships and early sales through events, partner calls, follow-ups, and public speaking.
