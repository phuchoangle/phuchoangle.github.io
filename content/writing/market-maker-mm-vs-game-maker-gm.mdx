![Market Maker vs Game Maker](/images/writing/mm-vs-gm/mm-vs-gm-hero.jpeg)

When I first entered the crypto market, I was like a blank slate, not even knowing what blockchain is, nor the difference between a hot wallet and a cold wallet. Like many others, I roamed various groups on Telegram, followed KOLs on X (Twitter) to follow their calls, which was probably the easiest way for newcomers to track projects in the market. But you could guess the outcomes at the end after following these calls and shills.

Then, in early 2020, I began learning about Chainlink. The more I read and explored about Chainlink, the more I got immersed in the world of blockchain [1]. Chainlink gave me a strong belief that we would eventually see blockchain and smart contracts widely adopted everywhere and in every industry. During that period, I spent time reflecting and then changed my thesis/mindset when participating in the crypto market.

I tentatively divide the crypto industry into two main groups - Market Maker (MM) and Game Maker (GM).

Market Maker (MM) - also known as liquidity providers, ensure that there are always buyers and sellers in the market [2]. They help maintain price stability and smooth market operations. Especially in the crypto market, MMs are the ones creating the waves of FOMO for newcomers. Names like Wintermute, Jump Trading, or DWF Labs are too familiar to those who have been following the market for a long time, and along with their fame is their notoriety for unpredictable token pump/dump moves, such as the Terra Luna incident [3]. Retail investors follow MMs, thinking they can benefit by tracking MM's wallets and on-chain actions. But no, we are just a juicy prey. I always believe that they only show us what they want us to see. We might succeed once or twice, but just one mistake on the third time, and we could lose everything we gained before.

Game Maker (GM) - a term I came up with, though I'm not sure if anyone else has discussed or proposed this term before. Simply put, as the name suggests, this group consists of those who create the blockchain world, the ones who establish this financial game, and don't confuse them with KOLs. The voice of GMs carries significant weight in the community; their vision is the direction of the entire industry. GMs are not only geniuses in proposing ideas and visions, but they are also adept at realizing those ideas. They continuously contribute to the market's development, and most financial institutions, projects, and developers consider their comments/ contributions as guiding principles for product development.

For example, Satoshi Nakamoto, who created Bitcoin, laid the foundation for decentralized financial transactions with a perfect tokenomics mechanism [4]. To me, Satoshi is a true genius, creating an asset with a fixed supply of 21 million coins, where the amount of BTC mined halves every four years, and the difficulty increases as more people join the network. A seemingly simple yet logical mechanism, akin to discovering a gold mine with a fixed gold reserve; the early comers get more, and the more people join, the harder it gets to find gold. Satoshi laid the first brick in creating the cryptocurrency market; calling Satoshi one of the first GMs of this market is not an exaggeration.

Besides Satoshi, we cannot overlook Vitalik Buterin - one of the geniuses the entire crypto market admires. Vitalik proposed the development of Ethereum at the end of 2013 after seeing Bitcoin's limitations in handling complex applications. Vitalik aimed to create a more flexible platform allowing developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) based on smart contracts, leading to Ethereum's birth. Vitalik's goal was to build a next-generation blockchain platform, more robust and flexible than BTC. This alone showcases Vitalik's superior vision. Ethereum has always been a foundational platform for developers to realize their decentralized ideas, from decentralized exchanges to basic financial services of Web 3. From the battles among Layer 1 blockchains to the development direction of Layer 2 on Ethereum or Modular blockchains, if we look back, these concepts or narratives stem from Vitalik's blogs. Vitalik truly is one of the genius GMs of the market.

So, besides Satoshi with Bitcoin and Vitalik with Ethereum, who else are the GMs of the market? After hours of reading Chainlink blogs and repeatedly watching Sergey's presentations at conferences, I believe that Chainlink founders like Sergey Nazarov, Steve Ellis, and Ari Juels are among the Game Makers of the crypto market. That's why I once wrote an article about the atomic trio Bitcoin - Ethereum - Chainlink, three projects crucial in developing blockchain and making it more accessible to people [6].

Chainlink's whitepaper was launched by Sergey, Steve, and Ari in 2017 [7]. This was when the world first heard the term "Decentralized Oracle Networks" - a decentralized oracle network that connects data from the outside world to the blockchain. Being GMs, they understood the blockchain game very well; they knew blockchain's weakness was its isolation from the outside world. Smart contracts would have no application if data could not be exchanged between blockchain and the real world, rendering blockchain useless. Remember, all technology is created to improve human life and society. When Chainlink launched services like Price Feed or Automation (formerly Chainlink Keepers), we experienced an amazing summer, also known as DeFi summer. Behind the scenes, it was Chainlink that initiated the DeFi game, and even now, Chainlink continues to lead the way for DeFi projects. If you've ever seen the graphs of the Chainlink effect (referenced in [8]), you'll understand why I say Chainlink is a GM of this game. Because when Chainlink announced its mainnet on any chain, the number of developers on that chain grew exponentially. Chainlink provides the necessary tools to build a blockchain ecosystem, offering safe and secure data services to develop financial products. Leading DeFi Bluechip projects like AAVE or Synthetix always closely collaborate with Chainlink, ensuring they lead the market thanks to Chainlink's foundation. Currently, Chainlink has somewhat become a common standard for the DeFi market. And not just DeFi, when Chainlink launched Verifiable Random Function (VRF), it also created a more transparent playground for Gaming, allowing players to trust that items or NFTs are issued randomly without manipulation. Every product Chainlink launches serves as an important foundation for developers to create blockchain applications and services.

In fact, since its launch, Chainlink has been envisioned as a platform to help developers easily develop Dapps on blockchains, not just for DeFi but also for TradFi. Chainlink knows that the world will not only have public chains like BTC and ETH but thousands of such public chains competing for a share of the blockchain industry. Besides public chains, Chainlink also foresees that investment funds, corporations, and banks will participate and integrate this blockchain technology, known as bank chains. Of course, each bank or financial institution will develop and operate their own blockchain according to their purposes and needs. Therefore, Chainlink understands the importance of communication between public chains and private bank chains more than anyone else. These chains would be isolated islands without being connected, which is why Chainlink developed CCIP and wants the world to recognize CCIP as the global standard for blockchain communication, similar to what TCP/IP does for the current Internet. Indeed, there's no need to argue when CCIP has already proven to be one of the decade's technologies, being tested by SWIFT or DTCC in operating the largest financial platforms globally. The list of the largest financial institutions partnering with Chainlink to develop and promote the tokenization of real-world assets can be seen in this article [13], once again showcasing Chainlink's vision in the RWA space. Chainlink will be the one bringing trillions of dollars to on-chain trading. If the founders of Chainlink were not GMs, would they have conceived such ideas and turned them into reality?

There's additional information that many might not know, but it reinforces my belief that Chainlink's founders understand the blockchain game well and are among the creators of this game. Regarding Ari Juels, many know him as one of the most renowned professors in cryptography. Ari Juels co-authored the paper "Proofs of Work and Bread Pudding Protocols" in 1999, coined the Proofs of Work concept [9]. Proofs of Work is the basic mechanism that helped Satoshi and Vitalik develop early Bitcoin and Ethereum. Also, many have heard of MEV (Miner Extractable Value), a concept proposed by Ari and his team in the paper "Flash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges" [10]. All technology is developed based on academic research, and the above evidence shows that Ari is a leading cryptography scientist. Some of the most complex and important concepts and mechanisms in the blockchain world come from Ari's research. As for co-founder Sergey, he might be the first to conceive the idea of smart contracts for blockchain, buying the domain "smartcontract.com" in 2008 [11], while Vitalik introduced Ethereum and popularized smart contracts to the community in 2013. More importantly, Sergey and Chainlink have been working with SWIFT long before launching their first DeFi mainnet service on 30/05/2019. Chainlink won an "Innotribe Industry Challenge" organized by SWIFT at Sibos 2016 [12]. Since then, Chainlink has been working with SWIFT to develop CCIP technology to solve communication issues between Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). Chainlink has been working with SWIFT even before launching their first DeFi mainnet service in 2019.

Based on the above information and arguments, I believe that besides BTC and ETH, Chainlink is one of the GMs of this market. As individuals, not everyone is born to be a trader. We are trained and work in various fields, where we excel and create value for society. I realized that I want to minimize the number of decisions and actions I make because the more I act, the higher the probability of making mistakes. So instead of spending hours checking on-chain data and drawing green and red lines on charts to follow what the MMs are doing, I choose to do less. I choose to follow this market in the long term because this market has not just appeared for one or two years and then disappeared; it is here to stay. I want to win this game once and for all. But to succeed in the long term and increase the probability of winning, I need to follow the right people, so I choose to follow the Game Makers - that is Chainlink.

So, instead of tracking Market Makers, I choose to follow the Game Maker Chainlink.
