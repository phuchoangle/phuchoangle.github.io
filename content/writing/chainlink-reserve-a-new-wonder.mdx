Chainlink announced their 2.0 economy 4 years ago (April 2021). Until now, we are gradually seeing the completeness of the system as well as the top-tier vision of Sergey and the team at Chainlink.

Simply put, the Chainlink 2.0 economic model describes how the Chainlink system operates to have a stable revenue source and help the network develop sustainably. Additionally, it shows how they can reward parties participating in operating and securing the network such as oracle nodes and stakers.

For example, the SCALE program with blockchain foundations, or supporting Web3 start-ups in the BUILD program, are important financial sources in this 2.0 economy. With deals agreed with blockchains in SCALE and projects in BUILD, Chainlink receives financial benefits. This financial part supports the entire ecosystem to stimulate general development.

Chainlink Reserve is the newest piece in the 2.0 economy. To me, this is currently the most important piece helping the community see the value of the entire Chainlink network more clearly, and how Chainlink designs their game to capture value for the LINK token.

Below we will go deeper to see how Chainlink Reserve operates.

### Chainlink Reserve Strategic Fund

Chainlink Reserve is a strategic reserve fund for the LINK token, operated and stored on-chain by Chainlink itself. The goal of this reserve is to hold LINK long-term to support the growth, development, and sustainability of Chainlink in the future. Because demand from businesses and large financial institutions is currently rising strongly, Chainlink wants to use this revenue to accumulate LINK, thereby strengthening economic power and network resilience.

Buying LINK tokens for the Chainlink Reserve is operated through Payment Abstraction (recently finished audit). With Payment Abstraction, projects using Chainlink services can pay for services using many different token types. For example, they can pay directly with gas tokens or stablecoins instead of paying directly with LINK. After receiving service money, by combining other Chainlink services and DEXs like Uniswap V3, the system automatically converts these payments into LINK. It then pays Service providers (oracle nodes and stakers), and transfers a portion to the Chainlink Reserve fund.

Currently, revenue contributing directly to Chainlink Reserve comes from on-chain and off-chain revenue.

1.  **On-chain portion:** Includes various fee sources such as VRF, Automation, Functions, and CCIP technologies. Chainlink also receives a portion of fees from deals with large DeFi projects. For example, GMX (currently GMX shares 1.2% of their fees with Chainlink thanks to Data Stream service), or AAVE SVR (Chainlink receives 35% from the recovered liquidation MEV value). Additionally, this part comes from tokens of projects in the BUILD program.

2.  **Off-chain portion:** This is notable. This may be the first time Chainlink mentions their off-chain revenue. Thanks to enterprise integrations, usage, and maintenance, large enterprises from TradFi have brought HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS in revenue to Chainlink, and they usually pay off-chain to use services.

This is because Chainlink currently plays the role of a secure connection layer between traditional systems, public and private blockchains, and between blockchains themselves. Chainlink is also the technology trusted by parties in issuing digital assets, stablecoins, and tokenized products. The result of these deals is that many applications are active and many projects are about to deploy for the world's leading financial institutions.

Since the announcement, the Chainlink strategic reserve fund holds about 65,550 LINK, currently worth about 1.4 million dollars ($LINK = $21 - https://metrics.chain.link/reserve).

Chainlink announced they will not use this reserve fund for many upcoming years, aiming to let the fund grow year by year thanks to revenue.

### Why is Chainlink Reserve Important for both Chainlink and the Community?

Chainlink occupies ~67.77% of the decentralized oracle market share, protecting over 80 billion USD in asset value across different blockchain ecosystems. Chainlink almost completely holds market share in the DeFi sector with over 2000+ projects integrated and using Chainlink services. Chainlink will certainly hold TradFi market share soon, as we see them collaborating to develop with the world's largest financial organizations, such as SWIFT and DTCC.

The most recent example is the announcement yesterday of cooperation with ICE (Intercontinental Exchange), the parent company of NYSE (New York Stock Exchange), to put forex (foreign exchange) and precious metal data on the blockchain. This means financial data from one of the world's largest financial centers will become transparent and accessible through Chainlink technology.

All business cooperation announcements Chainlink has shared will soon go into the practical deployment phase. Along with on-chain revenue, revenue from these off-chain business contracts will become on-chain $LINK buyback activities. $LINK will play a central role in accumulating Chainlink network value, both driving and benefiting from the increase in protocol usage levels.

Looking at the Chainlink Reserve Flywheel we see the growth loop:

* As more traditional financial institutions and DeFi apply Chainlink, revenue from both on-chain and off-chain will increase.
* This revenue is brought on-chain through Payment Abstraction. If it is not $LINK, it is automatically converted to $LINK on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap.
* That LINK flows into Chainlink Reserve, turning this fund into an "on-chain LINK accumulation machine" fed by the protocol's own growth.
* In the future (many years later) when the Reserve is used, this financial source will be reinvested to expand utility and protocol value for users. This creates a sustainable network thanks to fee revenue.
* The more useful and valuable the network, the more users it attracts -> revenue increases -> Reserve gets larger -> the cycle repeats and accelerates demand.

Imagine in the future, when trillions of USD in assets are tokenized on-chain and Chainlink becomes the global standard for modern finance. Chainlink Reserve will be able to accumulate LINK faster than the rate Chainlink Labs withdraws to use for protocol development. Chainlink Reserve becomes a sustainable "LINK storage warehouse", together with Chainlink Staking. At this time, Chainlink Reserve will be a strategic economic tool for Chainlink. This will reinforce Chainlink's long-term sustainable development, create motivation for stakeholders, and shape LINK's position in the blockchain technology industry.

To my personal knowledge, no blockchain project has designed and developed a complex economy, perfect in covering every aspect, meticulous in every piece for an overall financial picture like Chainlink has been doing. For a long time, I have always told people in the Vietnam Chainlink community that Chainlink Staking is a World Wonder of the crypto world. Now we see a new wonder, also created by Chainlink itself: Chainlink Reserve.

With Chainlink's all-star team, along with the brilliant minds and infinite vision of Game Makers like Sergey Nazarov and Ari Juels, we will soon see another new crypto wonder from Chainlink, creating a complex of wonders built by Chainlink. all efforts to build this wonder are to bring the current financial economy on-chain, helping the new world financial economy operate more smoothly and effectively.

In summary, Chainlink announcing this Chainlink Reserve can be viewed as the moment of flipping the **Fee switch** that blockchain projects often use as a metaphor. This Fee switch is a signal that Chainlink has entered a mature stage, developing exceptionally and aiming for sustainable development, rather than being in the initial construction phase trying to survive.

Yes, the switch is ON.
