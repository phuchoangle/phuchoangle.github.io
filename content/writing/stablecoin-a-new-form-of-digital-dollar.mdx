The global financial system is at a turning point. We are witnessing the transition from a traditional economy to an on-chain financial economy. This systemic shift has an impact comparable to past events like the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, which established the post-WWII monetary system, or the Nixon Shock in 1971, when the monetary system was decoupled from gold.

With the wave of digital assets spreading globally, and the SEC accepting financial funds providing BTC and ETH ETF trading services, public recognition of digital assets is growing faster than ever. Traditional finance stakeholders (TradFi) are seeing the feasibility and potential of blockchain technology. They see that blockchain can upgrade the current system to a new level.

One of the classic use cases accelerating blockchain adoption is the stablecoin. Stablecoins seem simple, but their potential is vast. They can help the US government consolidate its position and increase its influence on the world economic stage.

The Trump administration understands this clearly. That is why, immediately upon taking office, they focused on developing and launching the Stablecoin GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) Act last May.

The GENIUS Act was passed by the Senate on June 17 and by the House today, July 18. The GENIUS Act will establish a federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. This includes requirements for licensing, reserves, information disclosure, and compliance for issuers.

This Act is the first major milestone. It opens the beginning of a new generation financial economy, the on-chain economy, and helps the US consolidate its "big brother" position in the world through the power of the dollar.

#### **The Emergence of Stablecoin: Technological Foundation for the New Digital Dollar**

![The Emergence of Stablecoin](/images/writing/stablecoin/stablecoin-hero.jpeg)

Looking back at the past, humans have always proactively invented new forms to store value through currency. This aims to increase convenience for exchanging goods and trading as nations began to exchange value. From using goods to exchange directly, to using gold and silver bars in transactions, humanity invents a new form every few hundred years.

From the 20th and 21st centuries, as humans began to focus on developing science and technology, this gap of hundreds of years shortened to just a few decades. We see a new form of monetary transaction roughly every 50 years. From coins used for transactions developing into paper/polymer money, then digitized into digital money for online payments and various payment cards. With the birth of Bitcoin and Ethereum, we witnessed a new form of value exchange through tokens on the blockchain (called on-chain payment). Stablecoin is one of these token types. It appeared very early when DeFi on blockchain blossomed and has existed long enough to prove its value and potential.

Stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed specifically to maintain stable value by pegging its value to a reserve asset. Although there are different models (including those backed by commodities, valuable crypto, or complex algorithms), the most systemically important and popular type is fiat-backed stablecoins. For example, USD stablecoins maintain a 1:1 value with the US dollar. The stability of these stablecoins comes from issuers holding high-quality reserve assets with liquidity equivalent to the value of the coins in circulation.

The core point of these stablecoins is combining the stability and trust of traditional national currency with the revolutionary attributes of blockchain technology. They allow nearly instant transactions, operate 24/7 globally, have minimal costs, and are programmable through smart contracts. The simplest example is transferring money from one country to another in about 1 second, which is impossible for the current system. This combination creates a new, efficient, and accessible form of digital money, representing a significant upgrade over the traditional financial system.

#### **The Superior Growth and Popularity of Stablecoin**

We can easily see the acceptance and popularity of stablecoins through USDC and USDT. These stablecoins are widely used for trading on blockchain platforms, both on Centralised exchanges (CEX) and Decentralised exchanges (DEX). When traders want to buy any digital asset, such as popular assets like BTC, ETH, or altcoins, they use USDC/USDT to exchange. This directly assigns the value of these digital assets to the US Dollar exchange rate. Importantly, it indirectly makes the US Dollar the standard currency for valuing crypto transactions. We rarely see anyone mention 1 BTC = 102,000 Euro or 1 BTC = 3.1 billion VND. We only see 1 BTC = $120,000 USD (BTC's ATH at the time of writing).

![Stablecoin Market Cap](/images/writing/stablecoin/stablecoin-market-cap.png)

The growth of stablecoins is evident in the numbers achieved since their appearance. The capitalization of all stablecoins in the early 2020s was only about 5 billion dollars. The current capitalization of the entire stablecoin industry reached 258 billion dollars in July 2025, increasing more than 50 times in just over 5 years. The total capitalization of stablecoins currently (07/2025) accounts for 7.15% of the entire cryptocurrency industry capitalization (about 3.66 trillion). Large long-standing payment systems like Visa and Mastercard have monopolized global payments for nearly a century. They now must pay attention to the stablecoin ecosystem when looking at transaction volume on blockchain networks. According to Cex.io, stablecoin transaction volume in 2024 far exceeded the two giants in the traditional payment industry, reaching 27.6 trillion dollars. This number is 7.68% higher than the total transactions of Visa and Mastercard combined. Notably, stablecoin transaction volume nearly touched the 10 trillion mark in the last 3 months of 2024.

On the other hand, with data from Citigroup, stablecoin transaction volume was recorded at about 100 billion in 2019. Just 2 years later, recorded volume exceeded 5000 billion in 2021. This transaction volume is growing continuously every year and approaching the transaction volume of Visa and Mastercard, about 10,000 billion. With this growth momentum, stablecoin transaction volume will certainly surpass the two traditional giants in the coming years.

Although the data from CEX.io and Citigroup differ (depending on factors like data collection and processing methods), these figures show one common thing. Stablecoins are developing in a superior and phenomenal way compared to payment formats that existed decades before. Stablecoins took only over 2 years to catch up and threaten the position of traditional payment methods.

This number will not stop here. JPMorgan believes that stablecoin market capitalization alone could reach 500 billion dollars by 2028-2029. Standard Chartered also predicts market capitalization will reach 2 trillion dollars by this time. in the most optimistic scenario from Citigroup, they believe the market could reach 3.7 trillion dollars by 2030 under favorable conditions with full supporting legal frameworks.

A very new digital asset, less than 10 years old but with capitalization over 250 billion dollars and transaction volume exceeding giants holding global payment monopolies, proves this exponential growth is not a temporary trend. Stablecoins achieved this thanks to practical application and wide acceptance throughout the blockchain industry. Stablecoins are the third most popular crypto asset used for trading and holding, only after Bitcoin and Ethereum.

We will see more organizations, especially banks and traditional financial businesses, participating in this market. Stablecoins backed by USD will gradually become the most popular digital asset type. The number of market participants will depend on how many different product types the market needs to meet customer demands. With the advantage that stablecoins can flexibly optimize functions through smart contracts, it is highly likely that this market will have many more users than the payment card sector in the future.

#### **From a New Format of Digital Dollar to a New Generation US Financial Weapon**

With the preliminary data above, stablecoins have affirmed their position and superior potential in the global financial market at this stage. Mr. Trump's team of politicians and financial advisors seem to have recognized the role of cryptocurrency early in his campaign. His continuous expression of support for Bitcoin and the crypto market is not just to attract votes from billionaires and the pro-crypto community. More deeply, Trump understands that cryptocurrency, specifically stablecoins, is a key strategic advantage helping the US maintain its leading position in the global economic race. In the context where powers like China, Russia, Brazil, and India realize the power of the US dollar (the core foundation of the US economy) and join forces in the BRICS alliance to promote "de-dollarization" to weaken the dollar's role, stablecoins become a strategic weapon for the US to deal with this challenge.

![Stablecoin as US Financial Weapon](/images/writing/stablecoin/stablecoin-us-weapon.png)

To understand why stablecoins are a strategic weapon for the US, let us first discuss the current tool helping the US establish and maintain global financial hegemony in the 21st century. The petrodollar system. This article will not discuss the history of the Petrodollar, but only its structure which helps the US establish US dollar dominance.

The petrodollar system is one of the silent pillars helping the US dollar maintain its dominant position internationally. The story begins with global demand for oil, something almost every nation needs. To import oil, countries are forced to gather US dollars. This creates a continuous and almost "artificial" demand for this currency, unrelated to normal trade. This is like an unwritten rule. To get oil, you first must have dollars. This mechanism ensures the USD is always sought after worldwide.

But the story does not stop there. Oil-exporting countries, especially Gulf nations with small populations and developing economies, often accumulate huge dollar surpluses. Imagine. In 2022 alone, OPEC members collected 888 billion USD from oil exports. This number is so large it far exceeds their domestic investment capacity. So where does that money go? This is where the petrodollar system works. The 1974 agreement between the US and oil-exporting countries ensures these surpluses are "recycled" back into the US financial system, mainly through buying US Treasury bonds. These bonds are not only safe but have high liquidity, making them ideal places for these countries to store their excess money.

Overall, the petrodollar creates a perfect cycle. Countries need dollars to buy oil, oil exporters accumulate dollars, and those dollars flow back to the US through investments in public debt. The result is that the US dollar is not only reinforced by global demand but also supported by the very surpluses it creates. That is how this system, with a simple but sophisticated structure, helps the USD keep the throne in the global economy.

Now, stablecoins with a sophisticated and complete legal framework show they will be a new financial tool alongside the petrodollar, helping the US increase economic power. This legal framework is not just about crypto regulation. It is a strategic plan to build a digital dollar network operated by the private sector but closely monitored by the state, serving US economic and political goals.

According to the GENIUS act, only licensed issuers, usually subsidiaries of banks or federally regulated financial institutions, are allowed to issue stablecoins in the US. This creates a thoroughly controlled ecosystem, similar to how the petrodollar binds nations to the US financial system. More importantly, the requirement for 1:1 reserves with super-safe assets having high liquidity like USD cash, insured bank deposits, and especially short-term Treasury bonds ensures each stablecoin is tightly pegged to the value of the US dollar. Prohibiting the reuse or mortgage of reserves further reinforces reliability. Mandatory monthly reserve asset disclosure turns stablecoin into a digitized version of the USD, almost a "dollar bill" on the blockchain.

Just as the petrodollar recycles oil surpluses into US public debt, stablecoins also "lock" value into the US financial system through these reserve assets. Stablecoins create a more direct channel. Every transaction using stablecoins on CEX or DEX exchanges is an affirmation of stablecoin demand. The higher the demand to trade and own stablecoins, the more stablecoins will be issued. Therefore, this means demand to buy and hold USD or government bonds will be higher. Importantly, this money will be locked in the treasury to ensure stablecoin value. For example, Tether is just a private company, but they are in the top 7 entities buying the most US bonds in the world, higher than Canada, Taiwan, and Mexico.

Furthermore, this legal framework equips stablecoins with strong enforcement capabilities. Issuers must strictly comply with anti-money laundering (AML) laws and sanctions, with technology allowing the seizure or even "burning" of tokens related to illegal activities. This feature will be extremely important and strategic for the US, as the US frequently issues sanction policies against countries they view unfavorably. This is a tool the petrodollar does not have. The ability to control digital cash flow at the technological level. Moreover, by defining stablecoins as not being securities, the law clears the way for them to become pure payment tools, increasing global application and acceptance, just like how the USD dominates oil trade.

In summary, if the petrodollar was the machine helping the USD dominate the 20th century thanks to oil, then stablecoins, with a smart legal framework, will be the new weapon for the US dollar to continue leading in the digital era. It not only reinforces global demand for the USD but also creates a digital financial ecosystem where the US holds the central role, from treasury bond reserves to blockchain transactions. Stablecoins do not replace the petrodollar, but are an upgrade, bringing the power of the dollar into the high-tech world.

#### Conclusion

In summary, the rise of stablecoins attached to the US dollar is not just a financial trend but a strategic transformation of the United States in reshaping the global economic order. With giants like USDT, USDC, and now PayPal's PYUSD leading, this ecosystem has far exceeded the 250 billion USD capitalization figure, proving the irresistible attraction of the digital dollar.

Especially when over 80% of transactions take place outside the US and almost the entire market depends on the USD, stablecoins are turning into a true "financial bridge" for millions of people in emerging markets. In these places, inflation and capital controls make life difficult. This is not just a story of crypto traders, but how the dollar infiltrates every corner of the daily economy, far exceeding the slow limits of the traditional banking system.

Compared to the petrodollar (based on oil and wholesale trading), stablecoins bring a modern model with speed, global retail accessibility, and flexibility from blockchain technology. It not only reinforces the USD position but also gives the US a sharper financial control tool, from observing global cash flow to enforcing sanctions at the protocol level. The Stablecoin financial weapon, with power from technological innovation and the deep capital market of the US, is forcing opponents to play by rules set by the US.

This is an extremely smart and calculated move by the US, putting the dollar at the center of the digital economy, ensuring the US continues to lead in the 21st century.

P/s: I see proposals to translate **Stablecoin as "đồng tiền mã hóa ổn định" (stable cryptocurrency)**. This phrase is very long, hard to use, and obscure. I think we can use **stablecoin** directly, without translation, used like foreign words we use daily such as radio or TV.

Or, we can use the phrase **"cryptodollar", translated as "đô la mã hóa"**. In this case, stablecoins backed by US dollars can be translated as encrypted US dollars, stablecoins backed by Vietnamese currency as encrypted Vietnamese currency. With the GENIUS act, we can default to assets pegged 1:1 to reserve assets, without needing to mention its stability.
